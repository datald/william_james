Charles Sanders Peirce, generally considered to be its founder, later described it in his pragmatic maxim: Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object. Pragmatism rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality. Instead, pragmatists consider thought an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics\u2014such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science\u2014are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes. The philosophy of pragmatism 'emphasizes the practical application of ideas by acting on them to actually test them in human experiences'. Pragmatism focuses on a \u201cchanging universe rather than an unchanging one as the Idealists, Realists and Thomists had claimed\u201d.", "alternateName": "", "additionalType": "Concept", "name": "Pragmatism", "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Philbar_3.png"}
