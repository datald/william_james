The first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States, James was one of the leading thinkers of the late nineteenth century and is believed by many to be one of the most influential philosophers the United States has ever produced, while others have labelled him the 'Father of American psychology'. Along with Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey, he is considered to be one of the major figures associated with the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James' work has influenced intellectuals such as \u00c9mile Durkheim, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty, and has even influenced Presidents, such as Jimmy Carter.", "sameAs": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James", "name": "William James", "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/William_James_b1842c.jpg", "birthPlace": "New York City, New York", "@type": ["Person"], "birthDate": "+1842-01-11T00:00:00Z", "deathPlace": "Tamworth, New Hampshire"}
