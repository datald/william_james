    "description": "Erkenntnis is a journal of philosophy that publishes papers in analytic philosophy. Its name is derived from the German word for knowledge recognition. When Hans Reichenbach and Rudolf Carnap took charge of Annales der Philosophie in 1930 they renamed it Erkenntnis, under which name it was published 1930-1938. The journal was published by the Gesellschaft für Empirische Philosophie, or the Berlin Circle and the Verein Ernst Mach, Vienna. In the first issue Reichenbach noted that the editors hoped to gain a better understanding of the nature of all human knowledge through consideration of the procedures and results of a variety of scientific disciplines, whilst also hoping that philosophy need not remain a series of 'systems' but could reach the state of being objective knowledge.[1] The final issue of the first series, Volume 8, No. 1 was published in 1939 and retitled The Journal of Unified Science (Erkenntnis) (1939-1940) and included as associate editors Philipp Frank, Jörgen Jörgensen, Charles W. Morris, Otto Neurath and Louis Rougier. The advent of World War II led to the cessation of publication.[1]"
