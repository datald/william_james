{"additionalType": "Concept", "name": "Verificationism", "@context": ["http://schema.org"], "image": "", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verificationism", "alternateName": "Verification Principle", "@type": ["Thing"], "sameAs": "", "description": "Verificationism, also known as the verification principle or the verifiability criterion of meaning, is the philosophical doctrine that only statements that are empirically verifiable (ie. verifiable through the senses) are cognitively meaningful. / Verificationism thus rejects as cognitively 'meaningless' statements specific to entire fields such as metaphysics, theology, ethics and aesthetics. Such statements may be meaningful in influencing emotions or behavior, but not in terms of truth value, information or factual content. Verificationism was a central thesis of Logical Positivism, a movement in analytic philosophy that emerged in the 1920s by the efforts of a group of philosophers who sought to unify philosophy and science under a common naturalistic theory of knowledge. / The verifiability criterion underwent various revisions throughout the 1920s to 1950s, but, by the 1960s, was deemed to be irreparably untenable. Its abandonment signaled the end of the entire movement launched by logical positivism."}
