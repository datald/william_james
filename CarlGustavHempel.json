  "description": "Carl Gustav 'Peter' Hempel (January 8, 1905 \u2013 November 9, 1997) was a German writer and philosopher. He was a major figure in logical empiricism, a 20th-century movement in the philosophy of science. He is especially well known for his articulation of the deductive-nomological model of scientific explanation, which was considered the 'standard model' of scientific explanation during the 1950s and 1960s. He is also known for the raven paradox (also known as 'Hempel's paradox').",
